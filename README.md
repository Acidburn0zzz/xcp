# XCP-ng

XCP-ng is a "reboot" of old XCP, which was ditched when XenServer was Open Sourced. Since XenServer 7.3 removed free features, Olivier Lambert decided to resurrect XCP, this time with a full community effort and not just a Citrix project.

## Goals

1. The main goal is to be able to enjoy Xenserver power (XAPI/features) with a real community backed solution (not "one company dependent")
2. We want this to be 100% compatible with XenServer (as possible): ie being able to transfer VMs from XS to XCP-ng and vice-versa
3. Same for XAPI to be 100% compatible with Open Source management solutions (Xen Orchestra)
